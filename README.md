# Grub Compass

I'm building a compass that will point me and my friends to a random restaurant nearby.

We always have trouble deciding on a place to eat, so I'm building a device that does the job for us. After randomly picking a restaurant within a certain radius from our location, the compass needle will point in the direction of the unknown location. We then need to follow the compass until we reach the restaurant.
